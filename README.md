# Data-Leak-Handiling
While working for an educational technology company that developes an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

My team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with a customer. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. I was asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

I thereby analysed the information given and provided my input on the incident. 

~Attached are screenshots of the worksheet that was completed by me.
